Purpose:
In a large Unity project, it's common to leave behind Debug logs (Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, Debug.LogError) during development for testing and troubleshooting. Manually removing all these logs can be time-consuming and prone to error.

Solution:
The Debug Remover Tool is a custom Unity Editor tool that automatically scans your given script and removes all Debug statements with a single click, saving time and effort. It ensures cleaner code for release builds.
