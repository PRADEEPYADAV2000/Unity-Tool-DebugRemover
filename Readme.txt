🛠️ Debug Remover Tool for Unity

📌 Purpose

In large Unity projects, developers often use Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, and Debug.LogError for troubleshooting. However, leaving these logs in the final build can clutter the console and impact performance. Manually removing them is time-consuming and error-prone.

🚀 Solution

The Debug Remover Tool is a custom Unity Editor tool that scans a given script and automatically removes all Debug statements with a single click. This ensures cleaner, optimized code for release builds.

🎯 Features

✅ Automatically scans and removes all Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, and Debug.LogError statements.
✅ One-click cleanup from the Unity Editor.
✅ Prevents unintentional debug logs from reaching production builds.
✅ Improves performance by reducing unnecessary log operations.

            

🏗️ How to Use

1. Import the Debug Remover Tool into your Unity project.


2. Open Unity and navigate to Tools > Debug Remover in the Editor menu.


3. Select the script you want to clean.


4. Click "Remove Debug Logs"—all Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, and Debug.LogError statements will be automatically removed.



Future Enhancements

Batch processing – Remove Debug logs from multiple scripts at once.

Backup feature – Save a copy before modifying files.

Customizable filtering – Choose to remove only certain types of Debug logs.
